# WordleProgram
Programs to play and solve the word guessing game Wordle. Traditional Wordle is 5 letter words, I've added functionality for words of length 3 to 13. 5 letter word lists were downloaded from source files of the original Wordle website. Other word lists were downloaded from bestwordlist.com  

I have 4 main algorithms
1. Random
2. MaxParts
3. AverageElim
4. MaxEntropy

These algorithms operate almost identically with the algorithms coded for my other project on Mastermind (also available on my GitHub). 

NOTES:
This is one of the first project I've coded using Python so there are probably many things that could be done better.
